Like 4 in a row but in a wave. To try it out click that puzzle piece in the toolbar while you're editing a wave and paste this address: http://4inawave.googlecode.com/files/4inaawave.0.8.xml

That's the address of the gadget, we'll probably make an installer address soon so you can have 4inawave in your toolbar.
